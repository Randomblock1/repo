**_Requires KernBypass_**

This package creates a daemon for KernBypass so you don't have to constantly run commands.
This also means you can ldrestart to your heart's content, and KernBypass will autostart.
This is a temporary package; it will most likely be merged into KernBypass, and when it does, this will be taken down.
